    <string name="about_us_text">As Arabella Weir has said, \"I cry at everything, even the length of the queue at Sainsbury\'s\". Only in our case, it’s not Sainsbury’s. It’s the printing shops in our institute. And so, we, an ambitious team of four engineers in the making, have come up with an innovative solution and have decided to share it with you! *insert more buttered up stuff here*.\nNow, seriously.\nMost probably, you or someone you know have stood in a queue for a long time to maybe get just a sheet of paper printed. And man, are those minutes irritating. So, we have come up with an app which would solve this problem. Also, sPrint uses Google’s servers so your data is secure. That’s all folks. :)</string>
